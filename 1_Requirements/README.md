**Student Report card Generator**

***Introduction:***

In this project , user can perform typical report card related functions like adding new student record and displaying, modifying, editing and deleting it. 

The key features  for the Student Report Card Generator are:

- Easily Accessible 
- Create student’s record
- Display all student’s record
- Search student’s record
- Modify student’s record
- Delete student’s record

***Research:*** 

This software is efficient in maintaining students details and can easily perform operations on students record. This software also reduces the workload of the teachers in school as all the details are stored in computer system and whenever the details marks of students needed it can be searched and displayed on the screen. 

- This software is suitable for small schools. 

***Cost, Features and Timeline*** 

**Cost:** 

- There is no fixed cost of building an application as it relies upon various variables including application highlights, functionalities.

**Features:**

- We can edit the marks of the student easily and generate the report again.
- It save the time of the teacher to calculate the percentage and rank and pass or fail.
- This software reduces paperwork.
- It is easy to handle students record.
- This software saves the time.
- Information of each student store is permanently.

**Time Line:**

- Earlier results used to get published in newspapers and people and sometimes people need to travel from one place to another just to see their result.
- Then some years later there came system of printed mark sheets, in which teachers has to fill the data of student and calculate percentage.
- At Present, this application can be used to calculate the percentage with just by entering marks of the student in each subject, thus saving time of the teacher.

***SWOT Analysis***

**Strength :**

- The strength of my project is the flexible code and its security by not making unauthorized people to access it .
- It is an automatic application method, so it will reduce human power.

**Weakness :**

- Though its an automated process, it not fully automated.
- Since, most of the colleges has their own websites to provide such facility I need to prove my project is better by making aware of the advantages.

**Opportunity:**

- Firstly, I want to prove myself by starting with people who goes for tuition's and by that I can implement it largely by creating my own opportunity through them.
- It will help the teachers to make the result quickly.

**Threats:**

- If the application is not password protected any unauthorized person can gets access to this application and can make miss use of it. 

***4 W and 1 H***
