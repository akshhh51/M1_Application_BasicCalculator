- ***INTRODUCTION:***

` `A calculator is a machine which allows people to do math operations more easily. For example, most calculators will add, subtract, multiply, and divide. Some also do square roots, and more complex calculators can help with calculus and draw function graphs. Calculators are found everywhere. A smartphone or other computer can also act as a calculator.

﻿***Functions:***

- A calculator is a device that performs arithmetic operations on numbers. The simplest calculators can do only addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. More sophisticated calculators can handle exponent ial operations, roots, logarithm s, trigonometric functions, and hyperbolic functions.

﻿***RESEARCH:*** 

The calculator has the following keys: 0 to 9, . , +, -, \*, /, ±, =, (reset) C, (clear) CE and 1-operand keys: 1/x, x^2 , square root. In any situation the calculator has to produce a correct result defined by the well-known arithmetic rules. If the calculation is impossible the calculator has to display information helping the user to resolve the erroneous situation like:

- On encountering a division by 0 the display should read "Cannot divide by 0" and typing the key “C” should reset the calculator. 
- On calculating the square root value of a negative operand the display should read "Wrong operand". 
- On erroneous operand or operation keys the display should read “Reset (C) to continue” or “Clear (CE) to continue” as appropriate. Of course, any situation can be cleared using the main reset key “C”.

- **When :**  While doing complex math problems for large numbers or getting an exact answer without any error.

- **Why:** Firstly, it is really useful for solving complex and hard problems, gives the exact solution within a sec, people will not have to waste much time on calculating the problems manually.

- **Where:** It  will be used mainly in grocery shops, small medical stores or in daily needs shops.

- **What:** It stores history of the previous solutions in it and gives the exact solution just within a second, If there’s any error it will show the error and tell us to make the problem right.

- **How:** With c programming language we can provide a flexible code to develop the application and also provide intuitive service to the user.

﻿***SWOT Analysis***

**Strength:**

- It is capable enough to solve most complex problems. 
- Allow students to make quick, accurate mathematical calculations. 
- To help students expand the scope of their mental abilities
- Calculator gives more accurate results than counting manually. 
- Useful to convert the units of measurements.

**Weakness:**

- Users will be so dependent on using calculators for counting
- Relaying too much on calculator for counting can embarrass the users.
- Calculator limits the knowledge of users.

**Opportunities:** 

- It is efficient for everyone as it is capable of solving complex problems so easily and saves time of the user.
- Basic calculators are affordable to most

**Threats:** 

- By using the calculators people looses the ability to do calculations manually as they want to save their time from doing calculations manually.
- Loss of figure in computation of higer numbers.
